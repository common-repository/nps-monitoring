== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How much does this plugin cost? =

The plugin is 100% free.  Knock yourself out.

= How can I get help? =

Visit http://www.npsmonitoring.com for any and all support inquiries.

= The NPS Survey is not showing up? =

Several things may be happening here.

The first possibility is that you already filled out the survey.  By design there are settings in your account at http://www.npsmonitoring.com that dictate how often the survey will be presented to users.  You can modify those settings to have the survey shown more often.

The second possibility (if you have never seen the survey even once) is that your wordpress theme may not support the wordpress action hook entitled "wp_footer".  This is a standard action hook used by almost all themes.  Please ensure that your theme uses this hook so that we are able to drop the NPS Monitoring widget onto your Theme.

= How do I know whether or not survey responses are being collected? =

If you login to your control panel at http://www.npsmonitoring.com you can browse individual response and well as see aggregate data and trends.
